# Simple Integration Walkthrough

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

Ethereum transactions cost gas, which means your dapp’s users cannot initiate them 
unless they already have some ether. Onboarding new users into Ethereum is a 
problem. GSN provides a solution by allowing a different entity, either you
or a third party, to pay for transactions.

In this article you learn how to accept transactions that are paid for by somebody 
other than the sender, how to sponsor transactions, and how to write a user interface
that uses GSN.



## Converting a Contract to Support GSN <a id="converting_a_contract_to_support_gsn"></a>

To accept transactions that are paid for by a separate entity you have to do several things:

1. If necessary modify your configuration file (in truffle, `truffle.js` or `truffle-config.js`)
  to require Solidity version 0.6.10 or higher:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    networks: {
        ...
    },
    compilers: {
      solc: {
        version: "^0.6.10"
      }
    }
  };
  ```
2. Add `@opengsn/gsn` in the dependencies, version 2.0.0 or higher.
```bash
npm install @opengsn/gsn@"^2.0.0" --save
```
3. Import the base contract, and inherit from it:
  ```javascript
  import "@opengsn/gsn/contracts/BaseRelayRecipient.sol";
  contract MyContract is BaseRelayRecipient { ... }
  ```
4. Create a constructor that sets `trustedForwarder` to the address of a trusted forwarder. 
The purpose is to have a tiny (and therefore easily audited) contract that proxies the 
relayed messages so a security audit of the GSN aware contract doesn’t require a security 
audit of the full `RelayHub` contract. 
[You can look here](../deployments/networks.md) to see the addresses 
to use on mainnet and various test networks.

1. Create a `versionRecipient()` function to return the current version of the contract.

1. Replace `msg.sender` in your code, and in any libraries your code uses, 
with `_msgSender()`. If you receive a normal Ethereum transaction (from another contract or external account that 
pays for its own gas, this value is identical to `msg.sender`. If you receive an etherless 
transaction, `_msgSender()` gives you the correct sender whereas `msg.sender` would be the 
above forwarder.



### Example: CaptureTheFlag

As a demonstration, 
[here 
is an extremely simple capture the flag game](https://github.com/qbzzt/opengsn/blob/master/01_SimpleUse/contracts/01_CaptureTheFlag.sol) that, when called, captures the flag and emits
an event with the old and new holders. 

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.6.10;

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT OR Apache-2.0

import "@opengsn/gsn/contracts/BaseRelayRecipient.sol";

contract CaptureTheFlag is BaseRelayRecipient {
	string public override versionRecipient = "2.0.0";

	event FlagCaptured(address _from, address _to);

	address flagHolder = address(0);

        // Get the forwarder address for the network
        // you are using from
        // https://docs.opengsn.org/deployments/networks.html
	constructor(address _forwarder) public {
		trustedForwarder = _forwarder;
	}

	function captureFlag() external {
		address previous = flagHolder;

                // The real sender. If you are using GSN, this
                // is not the same as msg.sender.
		flagHolder = _msgSender();  

		emit FlagCaptured(previous, flagHolder); 
	}
}
```


### How does it Work?

Obviously, blockchain access is still not free. You get these GSN transactions
with the help of two entities. The user's application talks to a **_relay server_**, one of 
a number of servers that offer to send messages into the chain. The relay 
then talks to a **_paymaster_**, a contract that decides which transactions to 
finance based on the sender, the target contract, and possibly additional information.

Paymasters are contracts, so they are always available, similar to any other 
Ethereum contract. Relays are internet sites which get paid by paymasters for 
their services. Running a new relay is cheap and easy 
([see directions here](../javascript-client/running-own-relay.md)). 
We expect that anybody who opens a dapp for relayed calls will also set up a relay or 
two, so there will be enough that they can't all be censored.

Note that everything the relays do is verified. They cannot cheat, and if a relay 
attempts to censor a client at most it can delay the message by a few seconds before 
the client selects to go through a different relay.

<img src="../images/paymaster_needs_gas.png" alt="" width="80%" />

To know what relays are available you consult a special contract called RelayHub. 
This hub also checks up on relays and paymasters to ensure nobody is cheating. 
[You can read more about it here](../javascript-client/interacting-with-relayhub.md).


## Creating a Paymaster <a id="creating_a_paymaster"></a>

Somebody needs to pay for your users’ transactions on the blockchain. In the future 
it might be a commercially available service, but for now the entity most likely to 
pay for your users’ transactions is you. In this section you learn how to create a 
paymaster to accomplish this.

Complete documentation of how to write a paymaster is beyond the scope of this tutorial, 
[you can read about it here](../contracts/index.md#token_paymaster). 
For the purpose of this tutorial, I am going to present a simple paymaster that accepts 
all requests to a specific contract, and nothing else. This can be an onboarding contract, 
which calls other contracts.

[You can see the complete code here](https://github.com/qbzzt/opengsn/blob/master/01_SimpleUse/contracts/02_NaivePaymaster.sol). 
Look below for a line by line explanation.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.10;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT OR Apache-2.0

import "@opengsn/gsn/contracts/forwarder/IForwarder.sol";
import "@opengsn/gsn/contracts/BasePaymaster.sol";

```
All paymasters inherit from `BasePaymaster`. That contract handles getting deposits, 
ensuring functions are only called by the relay hub, and so on.

::: tip Note:
This paymaster is naive because it is not a secure implementation. It can 
be blocked by sending enough requests to drain the account. A more sophisticated
paymaster would use [captcha](https://metacoin-captcha.opengsn.org/) or 
maybe [hashcash](https://metacoin-hashcash.opengsn.org/).
:::


```solidity
contract NaivePaymaster is BasePaymaster {
```

This variable holds the one target contract we are willing to pay for.

```solidity
    address public ourTarget;
```
When the owner sets a new target, we want to emit an event to inform the world about it.
```solidity
    event TargetSet(address target);
```
This function modifies the target contract we are willing to be a paymaster for. We 
can use `onlyOwner` because `BasePaymaster` inherits from `Ownable`.
```solidity
    function setTarget(address target) external onlyOwner {
        ourTarget = target;
        emit TargetSet(target);
    }
```
This is the paymaster’s most important function, the decision whether to pay for a 
transaction or not. The `GNSType.RelayRequest` type is defined 
[here](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn/blob/master/contracts/utils/GSNTypes.sol). 
It includes multiple fields - we’ll use the `.target`, which is the target contract.
The `signature` can be used to validate the `relayRequest` value.
```solidity
    function preRelayedCall(
	GSNTypes.RelayRequest calldata relayRequest,
	bytes calldata signature,
```
The approval data is sent by the web client through the relay. It can include any data the 
dapp needs to decide whether to approve a request or not.
```solidity
        bytes calldata approvalData,
```
This parameter can be used, in conjunction with `relayHub.calculateCharge()`, to calculate 
the cost a transaction would incur. Using it is beyond the scope of this basic tutorial.
```solidity
        uint256 maxPossibleGas
```
The `context` that the function returns is shared with the `postRelayedCall` method.
It is a way to share information about the call (for example, from the approval data) from the `pre-` to the `post-` method without an expensive state change.

The `rejectOnRecipientRevert` value that the function returns allows the Paymaster to delegate the decision to the recipient itself.
Using this feature is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

```solidity
    ) external override returns (bytes memory context, bool rejectOnRecipientRevert) {

```

Verify that the forwarder is the trusted forwarder for the network.

```solidity
        _verifyForwarder(relayRequest);
```

This paymaster is naive, but not a complete sucker. It only accepts requests going to our 
service. This is the way that `preRelayedCall` returns a rejection - either by
failing a `require`, by explicitly calling `revert`, or even just running out of gas. If we return any value from this function
normally it means that the paymaster is committed to paying for the transaction, and 
will do so even if the transaction ultimately fails.

CAUTION: Advanced Paymaster implementations may choose to override the `getGasLimits()` method of the `IPaymaster` interface.
Doing so can create to a configuration where paymaster commits to paying for a transaction after consuming some amount of gas.
See the [Advanced](../gsn-provider/advanced.md) section to learn more.

```solidity
        require(relayRequest.target == ourTarget);
```
We can return anything here, but for now we’ll just return the time. We want something we 
can emit with the pre- and post- processing so we’ll be able to match them when we look 
at the results.

::: tip Note:
This is not necessary. The pre and post processing are part of the same transaction, 
:::
so we could match the pre- and post-processing using the `txid`. However, I wanted to have 
a trivial example of using the context here.
```solidity
        return (abi.encode(now), false);
    }
```
This function is called after the relayed call. At this point the cost of the request 
is almost known (with the exception of the gas cost of `postRelayedCall` itself), and we can 
do any accounting we need, charge entities, etc.

```solidity
    function postRelayedCall(
        bytes calldata context,
        bool success,
```
The `gasUseWithoutPost` parameter provides the gas used for the transaction so far. It includes 
all the gas of the transaction, except for the unknown amount we are going to use in the 
`postRelayedCall` itself.

```solidity
	uint256 gasUseWithoutPost,
        GsnTypes.RelayData calldata relayData
    ) external relayHubOnly override {
        (success, preRetVal, gasUseExceptUs, gasData);
        emit PostRelayed(abi.decode(context, (uint)));
    }
```
This function returns the version of the paymaster contract. 
```solidity
    function versionPaymaster() external virtual view 
    override returns (string memory) {
        return "1.0";
    }
}
```

### Initializing the Paymaster

It is not enough to deploy the paymaster contract. Any paymaster contract needs to 
attach to a `RelayHub`, and if you use `NaivePaymaster` you also need to specify the target 
for which you are willing to pay. Additionally, the paymaster is not going to help 
anybody unless you actually fund it to be able to pay.

The directions below assume you are using [truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs) 
and that it is already configured for the network you are deploying into (either the 
real network or a test network).

1. Run the truffle command line interface:
+
```bash
truffle console --network <the network you are using>
```
1. Deploy the paymaster contract, and then display the address so you can store it 
somewhere for future use:
+
```javascript
paymaster = await <paymaster contract>.new()
paymaster.address
```
+
If you have already deployed the contract and know the address, do this:
+
```javascript
paymaster = await <paymaster contract>.at(<address>)
```
1. Specify the address of `RelayHub` on the network you’re using. 
[You can get that information here](../deployments/networks.md).
+
```javascript
paymaster.setRelayHub(<RelayHub address>)
```
1. Configure your paymaster. In the case of `NaivePaymaster`, this means to set the target.
+
```javascript
paymaster.setTarget(<target contract address>)
```
1. Transfer ether to the paymaster’s address.




## The User Interface <a id="the_user_interface"></a>

Your contract is not going to be very useful if users can’t use it. The way you interact 
with a contract using GSN is a bit different from the way you do it for a normal dApp,
because you need to go through a relay and you have no ether.

This tutorial only explains the basics of using GSN from a webapp.
[For more detailed 
documentation, look here](../javascript-client/getting-started.md).


### Using npm Packages

GSN is available as [an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/). This means that to use
it in a webapp you need to import it as a package, as if you were using 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (the server version of JavaScript) and then use a tool such 
as [browserify](http://browserify.org/) to make your code browser-compatible. This article 
teaches only the basics of using these tools, 
[
for more information see here](https://medium.com/jeremy-keeshin/hello-world-for-javascript-with-npm-modules-in-the-browser-6020f82d1072).

These are the steps to start the development:

1. Install browserify so it will be available as a script.
+	
```bash
sudo npm install -g browserify
```
1. Create and change to a directory.
1. Run this command to create the initial package definition file:
+
```bash
npm init -y
```
1. Install the GSN package and its dependencies:
+
```bash
npm install @opengsn/gsn@"^2.0.0" ethers
```
1. Write your code in a file, for example `index.js`. You can use 
[`require`](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/what-is-require/) just as you 
would with Node.js.
1. To compile the application into browser-compatible JavaScript, use this command:
+
```bash
browserify index.js -o bundle.js
```
+
::: tip Note:
At writing there is a bug that causes the output to have some junk characters. 
:::
Under Linux you can use the `tr` command to solve this:
+
```bash
browserify index.js | tr -dc '\0-\177' > bundle.js
```


### The user interface code

[You can see the user interface 
code here](https://github.com/qbzzt/opengsn/tree/master/01_SimpleUse/ui). Here are the important parts (first in the JavaScript file and then on 
the HTML page).

This is the configuration with the addresses of the relevant contracts (on the 
test network where they are deployed, Kovan) and the maximum acceptable gas price for 
our messages. The address of the contract we wish to contact is `conf.ourContract`.

```javascript
const conf = {
	ourContract: '0x23Cd0E36bB4727550bc01Cd3A1E8931b6d7CC796',
	notOurs:     '0x6969Bc71C8f631f6ECE03CE16FdaBE51ae4d66B1',
	paymaster:   '0x0572dc46eb6edc950aa37c12fa9c862d4165cbc5',
	relayhub:    '0x2E0d94754b348D208D64d52d78BcD443aFA9fa52',
	stakemgr:    '0x0ecf783407C5C80D71CFEa37938C0b60BD255FF8',
	gasPrice:  20000000000   // 20 Gwei
}
```

Get the `RelayProvider` object class, which is in the relay client.
```javascript
const Gsn = require("@opengsn/gsn/dist/src/relayclient/")
const RelayProvider = Gsn.RelayProvider
```

Get the function to create a new configuration. This function provides the default 
configuration, except for fields that are overridden by its parameter.
```javascript
const configureGSN =
	require('@opengsn/gsn/dist/src/relayclient/GSNConfigurator').configureGSN
```

This program uses the [`ethers.js`](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers-app/html/) package to 
communicate with the Ethereum network.
```javascript
const ethers = require("ethers")
```

Override these configuration parameters.
```javascript
const gsnConfig = configureGSN({
	relayHubAddress: conf.relayhub,
	paymasterAddress: conf.paymaster,
	stakeManagerAddress: conf.stakemgr,
	gasPriceFactorPercent: 70,
	methodSuffix: '_v4',
	jsonStringifyRequest: true,
```

This is the `chainId` for the [Kovan test network](https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/). 
You can see the `chainId` values for other networks [here](https://chainid.network/).
```javascript
	chainId: 42,
	relayLookupWindowBlocks: 1e5
})    // gsnConfig
```

The standard is to have the wallet manager in the browser (for example, MetaMask) expose 
a [`Web3`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3.html) compatible provider in 
`window.ethereum`. This provider is then wrapped by GSN, which creates a `RelayProvider` that 
is also compatible with `Web3`. Transactions are processed by GSN to allow them to go through 
a relay at zero cost, and then sent to the original wallet manager to be signed by the user.

The `ethers.js` package uses its own provider class. So to create the provider we’ll use, 
we take that GSN provider and use it as the parameter to the `ethers` provider constructor.
```javascript
const origProvider = window.ethereum;
const gsnProvider = new RelayProvider(origProvider, gsnConfig);
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(gsnProvider);
```

Information about the contract we are accessing.
```javascript
const flagAddr = conf.ourContract;
```

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is produced as an artifact by the Solidity compiler. 
It specifies the inputs of the various public functions, the arguments of events, and so on.
```javascript
// Copied from build/contracts/CaptureTheFlag.json
const flagAbi = [
    {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "address",
          "name": "_forwarder",
          "type": "address"
        }
      ],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "constructor"
    },
    .
    .
    .
    {
      "inputs": [],
      "name": "captureFlag",
      "outputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "function"
    }
  ];    // flagAbi
```

This function calls the contract using GSN. It is standard `ethers.js`, provided here for 
completeness.
```javascript
const gsnContractCall = async () => {

	await window.ethereum.enable();

```

The only network for which we have contact numbers is Kovan, whose `chainId` is 42. If the 
wallet is using any other network, we cannot call the contract.
```javascript

	if (provider._network.chainId != 42) {
		alert("I only know the addresses for Kovan");
		raise("Unknown network");
	}

	const contract = await new ethers.Contract(
		flagAddr, flagAbi, provider.getSigner() );
	const transaction = await contract.captureFlag();
	const hash = transaction.hash;
	console.log(`Transaction ${hash} sent`);
	const receipt = await provider.waitForTransaction(hash);
	console.log(`Mined in block: ${receipt.blockNumber}`);
};   // gsnContractCall
```

This function is almost identical to `gnsContractCall`. The difference is that it 
attempts to trick `NaivePaymaster` by using it to pay for access to a different contract.
[source.javascript]
```
const gsnPaymasterRejection = async () => {
	.
	.
	.
	const contract = await new ethers.Contract(
		conf.notOurs, flagAbi, provider.getSigner() );
	.
	.
	.
};   // gsPaymasterRejection


```



This function listens for events, which is free, so we can use the provider rather than 
a signer. It is also standard `ethers.js`, and provided here for completeness.
```javascript
const listenToEvents = async () => {
	const contract = await new ethers.Contract(
		flagAddr, flagAbi, provider);
```

This is an easy way to listen to events in `ethers.js`, and to parse them
once they are received
```javascript
	contract.on(contract.interface.events.FlagCaptured, 
		evt => console.log(`Event: ${
			JSON.stringify(contract.interface.parseLog(evt))}`)
	);

};  // listenToEvents
```

The namespace within a file that is going to pass through `browserify` is inaccessible for 
JavaScript written on the HTML page. By adding fields to the global variable window, we 
can provide that JavaScript with a link to our functions and parameters. We don't need 
all of these parameters for our program, but those we don't are useful for debugging.
```javascript
window.app = {
	gsnContractCall: gsnContractCall,
	listenToEvents: listenToEvents,
	gsnPaymasterRejection: gsnPaymasterRejection, 
	conf: conf,
	ethers: ethers,
	provider: provider,
	addr: flagAddr,
	abi: flagAbi
};
```

The HTML code can be very simple. There are two points to remember.

First, it is necessary to load the `bundle.js` script (or any other name) `browserify` 
creates out of our JavaScript code and the required libraries.
```html
<script src="bundle.js">
</script>
```

Second, to access the functions in our JavaScript we need to use the `window.app` field we 
created in the JavaScript.
```html
<script>
window.app.listenToEvents();
</script>

<button onClick="window.app.gsnContractCall()">
Send a free message to LastContract
</button>
```



## Local Tests <a id="local_tests"></a>

If you just want to run a couple of transactions to see that the dapp works you can 
use a test network such as Kovan, but such a network is too slow for serious testing.
To do that, you run the tests locally:


### Manual Tests

1. Start a local Ethereum simulator, such as [ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
1. Make sure that the truffle configuration file (either `truffle.js` or `truffle-config.js`)
  contains the necessary information to connect to that network.
1. Deploy the GSN contracts:
+
[source.bash]
```
node_modules/.bin/gsn start
```
1. See the contract numbers and relay URL at the bottom of the output
+
```

## startGSN: ready. <a id="startgsn:_ready."></a>
GSN started

  RelayHub: 0xCA3ef05158d0dBD38cC7B49FbBc979d4cB977Ccc
  StakeManager: 0x316e9B4bBBBC9B585918CD19357fA686df636D22
  Penalizer: 0xf905b7E384418de51A74758b31be97D9ef12Ab1F
  TrustedForwarder: 0x7Aa34e87a62378c1998f2E179EA18200faF866E7
  Paymaster : 0xC264199C89a1C7056731d2a289B1A5C3fD263CbF
Relay is active, URL = http://127.0.0.1:44703 . Press Ctrl-C to abort
```
1. Make sure you have the latest versions compiled and start the truffle console.
+
```
truffle compile
truffle console
```
1. Deploy the paymaster as explained above.
+
[source.javascript]
```
paymaster = await <paymaster contract>.new()
paymaster.setRelayHub(<Relay hub address from gsn command>)
```
1. Fund the paymaster (it will transfer the ether to the relay hub).
+
[source.javascript]
```
paymaster.send(1e18)
```
1. Deploy the target contract and configure the paymaster. If you are using
`CaptureTheFlag` and `NaivePaymaster`, do this:
+
[source.javascript]
```  
flag = await CaptureTheFlag.new(<trusted forwarder address from gsn command>)
paymaster.setTarget(flag.address)
```
1. Configure the settings you need to use GSN, similar to what you did in the user 
interface above. Remember to change `relayHubAddress`, `stakeManagerAddress`,
and `preferredRelays` to the values you got from `gsn start`. 
The `chainId` is set to `'*'` to accept
any chain.
+
::: tip Note
The gsnConfig definition should all be on one line. It is only separated here
:::
for clarity.
+
[source.javascript]
```
Gsn = require("@opengsn/gsn/dist/src/relayclient/")
RelayProvider = Gsn.RelayProvider
configureGSN = require('@opengsn/gsn/dist/src/relayclient/GSNConfigurator').configureGSN
ethers = require("ethers")

gsnConfig = configureGSN({
	paymasterAddress: paymaster.address,
	gasPriceFactorPercent: 70,
	methodSuffix: '_v4',
	jsonStringifyRequest: true,
	chainId: '*',
	relayLookupWindowBlocks: 1e5,
	relayHubAddress: '0xCA3ef05158d0dBD38cC7B49FbBc979d4cB977Ccc',
	stakeManagerAddress: '0x316e9B4bBBBC9B585918CD19357fA686df636D22',
	preferredRelays: [ 'http://127.0.0.1:43027' ],
	verbose: true
})    
```
1. Create the `Provider` object:
+
[source.javascript]
```
origProvider = web3.currentProvider
gsnProvider = new RelayProvider(origProvider, gsnConfig)
provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(gsnProvider)
```
1. Create an account:
+
[source.javascript]
```
acct = provider.provider.newAccount()
```
1. Create the `Contract` object (this is also all one line):
+
[source.javascript]
```
contract = await new ethers.Contract(flag.address, flag.abi, 
	provider.getSigner(acct.address, acct.privateKey))
```
1. Run the transaction and wait for it to finish:
+
[source.javascript]
```
transaction = await contract.captureFlag()
receipt = await provider.waitForTransaction(transaction.hash)
```
1. Get the last caller from the receipt, and compare it with the 
account that signed the request. There are additional events
from the paymaster, etc - but they do not concern us.
+
[source.javascript]
```
receipt.logs.map(entry => contract.interface.parseLog(entry))
acct.address
```




### Automated tests

You can see a complete automated test 
[here](https://github.com/qbzzt/opengsn/blob/master/01_SimpleUse/test/testcontracts.js). 
Here is a line by line explanation of the new parts.

This is the blockchain to connect to. If can be either `localhost`, the name of a known
blockchain (such as `kovan`), or a URL. 
[source.javascript]
```
const blockchain = "localhost"
```

The definitions required to use GSN.
[source.javascript]
```
const gsn = require('@opengsn/gsn')

const RelayProvider = require("@opengsn/gsn/dist/src/relayclient/").RelayProvider

const gsnTestEnv = require('@opengsn/gsn/dist/GsnTestEnvironment').default
const configureGSN = require('@opengsn/gsn/dist/src/relayclient/GSNConfigurator').
	configureGSN
.
.

The function that calls the contract is identical to what we did earlier. The only difference
is the way we interpret the results. The receipt includes logs entries for the 
events emitted by the transaction. To get the last caller from the event requires several steps:

1. Get the logs using `receipt.logs`.
1. Parse the log using the contract. The function `<contract>.interface.parseLog`
  parses a single log entry, provided it is an event emitted by the contract. If the
  function encounters an event that came from elsewhere, it returns `null`. Because it 
  only handles a single event, we 
  [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) 
  this function on `receipt.logs`. The output looks like this:
+
[source.json]
```
[
  null,
  _LogDescription {
    decode: [Function],
    name: 'FlagCaptured',
    signature: 'FlagCaptured(address,address)',
    topic: '0xacc718a11fbc93a22905740808767480f9efd07b1c0b0128095790cd1440048d',
    values: Result {
      '0': '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
      '1': '0xAcFEFc98e8977CBA2b12a467097a4267D9C4D5F0',
      length: 2
    }
  },
  null,
  null
]
```
1. Use [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) 
  to remove the `null` values.
1. There should be just one entry left, for the `FlagCaptured` event. The event parameters are 
  stored in `values` as an associative array, one with keys and values. To get the first value, 
  the previous holder, use `values['0']`. For the second one, the current holder, 
  use `values['1']`.

Putting it all together gives us this function which returns the previous holder of 
the flag.

[source.javascript]
```
const callThroughGsn = async (contract, provider) => {
	.
	.
	.
	const result = receipt.logs.
		map(entry => contract.interface.parseLog(entry)).
		filter(entry => entry != null)[0];

	return result.values['0']

};  // callThroughGsn
```

[The function 
call is standard truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript).

[source.javascript]
```
contract("CaptureTheFlag", async accounts => {
	.
	.
	.

	it ('Runs with GSN', async () => {
```

The `gsnTestEnv.startGsn` command starts GSN on the provided blockchain. 

[source.javascript]
```
		const gsnInstance = await gsnTestEnv.startGsn(blockchain);
```

The various addresses GSN uses on the blockchain are stored in 
`gsnInstance.deploymentResult`. Use them to initialize our contracts.

[source.javascript]
```
		const flag = await 
			CaptureTheFlag.new(gsnInstance.deploymentResult.forwarderAddress)

		const paymaster = await NaivePaymaster.new()
		await paymaster.setRelayHub(
			gsnInstance.deploymentResult.relayHubAddress)
		await paymaster.send(1e17)
		await paymaster.setTarget(flag.address)
```

This part is the same as what we did for manual testing, except for the 
GSN parameters coming from `gsnInstance` instead of being entered manually.

[source.javascript]
```
		const gsnConfigParams = {
			gasPriceFactorPercent: 70,
			methodSuffix: '_v4',
			jsonStringifyRequest: true,
			chainId: '*',
			relayLookupWindowBlocks: 1e5,
			preferredRelays: [ gsnInstance.relayUrl ],
			relayHubAddress: 
				gsnInstance.deploymentResult.relayHubAddress,
			stakeManagerAddress: 
				gsnInstance.deploymentResult.stakeManagerAddress,
			paymasterAddress: paymaster.address
		}

		.
		.
		.
```

The first time we call `CaptureTheFlag` we expect to get zero.

[source.javascript]
```
		var result = await callThroughGsn(contract, provider);
		assert.equal(result, 0, "Wrong initial last caller");
```

The second time we expect it to be the account that we used for the previous call.
The rest of the tests just create a second account and switch between them, verifying
that we get the correct account each time. THe addresses need to be changed in 
lowercase because [Ethereum 
uses the case of the letters a-f as a checksum](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md), and `acct.address` does not use that.

[source.javascript]
```
		var result = await callThroughGsn(contract, provider);
		assert.equal(result.toLowerCase(), acct.address.toLowerCase(), 
			"Wrong second last caller (should be acct)");

		.
		.
		.

	});   // it 'Runs with GSN'

});   // contract("CaptureTheFlag", ...)

```



## Conclusion <a id="conclusion"></a>

In this article you learned how to accept transactions from entities that can’t (or won’t) 
pay for them with their own gas. You also learned how to create a simple paymaster 
to pay for the transactions that you want to sponsor, for example those going to your 
own contract. You learned how to write JavaScript code that can run in the 
user's browser to send such free ethereum transactions, and then how to write unit 
tests for contracts going through GSN.


You should now be able to write your own GSN compatible dapps that users could use
without having to purchase ether. Hopefully, this will make user acquisition and onboarding
much less painful for the users, and therefore much more effective for you.
